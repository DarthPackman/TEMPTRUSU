        <p class="speaker-text"><b>Matthew Guzdial:</b>             Matthew Guzdial is a Assistant Professor at the University of Alberta whose research focuses on creative artificial intelligence and machine learning, with two major research vectors. The first is the application of AI/ML to domains we would typically consider requiring human creativity, which exposes limitations and potential for development of current AI/ML approaches. The second is the application of computational models of creativity to standard AI/ML tasks to improve the performance on these tasks.
